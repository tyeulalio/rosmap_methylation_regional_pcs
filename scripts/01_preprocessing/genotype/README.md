## VCF LiftOver Pipeline

This pipeline provides a step-by-step process to lift over VCF files from `hg19` to `hg38` using GATK's LiftoverVcf tool.

### Data Source

The data was sourced from the [ROMSAP harmonization whole genome sequencing as VCF files](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11707420). To download these files:

1. Navigate to the provided link.

2. Click on "Download Options" to find detailed instructions.

Note: Accessing this data requires a signed Data Use Agreement.

### Prerequisites

1. **Modules**: Before using the script, ensure the following modules are installed and available on your system:
    - `gatk/4.0.10.0`
    - `bcftools`

2. **Files & Directories**:
    - Source VCF files situated in the designated paths.
    - Reference fasta files for `hg19` and `hg38` must be correctly pointed in the script.
    - Chain file for liftOver, moving from `hg19` to `hg38`.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-dir]
```

### Run the script:

```
./liftover_script.sh
```

### Workflow

- **Concatenation**: Initially, chromosomes from the ROMSAP VCFs are concatenated. The code prepends "chr" in front of each chromosome to match the annotations in the LiftOver chain file.
- **Normalization**: The VCF undergoes normalization using the `bcftools norm` function. This step uses the `hg19 GATK resource bundle` for accuracy, retains multiallelic sites together (avoiding issues later in the pipeline), and swaps ref/alt alleles if incorrectly placed.
- **LiftOver**: This step employs GATK/4.0.10.0's `LiftoverVcf` tool to transform the VCF from `hg19` to `hg38`. The tool uses the `hg19tohg38` chain and references the `hg38` fasta genome file located in the SCG reference folder. It's critical to adjust the VCF header to include "chr" before chromosome definitions to ensure compatibility. The liftOver operation occasionally faces "out of memory" issues. To mitigate this, set `MAX_RECORDS_IN_RAM` to 500. If the problem persists, rerunning the script typically resolves it.
- **Final Normalization**: A final round of normalization is performed post LiftOver.

### Parameters

Inside the script, specific parameters are set at the beginning. These include paths to the required VCF files, reference genomes, and the chain file for LiftOver. To ensure the script works correctly in your environment, adjust these parameters as necessary.

### Additional Details

- The main code for this pipeline is found in `01_liftover_vcf.sh`.
- For reference sequences, the pipeline utilizes `/reference/RefGenomes/GATK_Resource_Bundle/hg38/hg38.fa`.
- If you encounter memory issues, rerunning the script is usually a quick solution, though it's not guaranteed to always work.

## <ins>Step 2:</ins>
## PLINK2 VCF Processing Script Instructions

This script provides utilities for converting VCF files into PLINK formats (both PGEN and BED) and extracting a specific sample from a VCF using PLINK2.

### Prerequisites:
1. **PLINK2**: Ensure you have PLINK2 installed. If you're using a system with module environments (like many HPC clusters), the script assumes you have a `plink2` module available.

2. **VCF File**: Have your VCF file ready. This script is designed for VCF files that have been normalized and can handle multiple chromosomes.

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository & Navigate to the Script**:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

2. **Script Parameters**: Open the script using your preferred text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`).

```
nano plink2_processing.sh
```

Adjust the following parameters at the top of the script:

- `INPUT_VCF_PATH`: Replace `../path_to_your_data/input_vcf_file.vcf` with the path to your input VCF file.

- `OUTPUT_PREFIX`: Replace `../path_to_output_dir/output_prefix` with the desired output directory path and prefix for your output files.

- `SAMPLES_KEEP_PATH`: Replace `../path_to_samples_dir/samples_to_keep.tsv` with the path to your samples file. This file should list the samples you wish to keep, one per line.

- `ONE_SAMPLE_PATH`: Replace `../path_to_samples_dir/one_sample.tsv` with the path to a file containing a single sample name you wish to extract from the VCF.

- Filters (`MIND_FILTER`, `HWE_FILTER`, `GENO_FILTER`, `MAF_FILTER`): Adjust these values as needed. They correspond to PLINK's `--mind`, `--hwe

## Running Mishap Test with PLINK

### Overview
This script runs the mishap test on genomic data using PLINK. The mishap test is designed to detect Mendelian inconsistenciesâ€”errors or inconsistencies in the inheritance patterns among related individuals. It's especially useful in studies that involve family data. The script specifically focuses on the dataset 'rosmap_wgs_hg38_all_chroms' and serves as Step 3 in our data analysis pipeline, tailored for research reproducibility.

### Pre-requisites
PLINK must be installed and accessible either through a module system or installed globally.
The dataset 'rosmap_wgs_hg38_all_chroms' should be present at the specified path.

### Usage
To execute the script, run the following command in your terminal, replacing <chromosome_number> with the number of the chromosome you wish to analyze:

```
./03_mishap_test.sh <chromosome_number>
```

### Script Behavior and Output
- The script will exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero status to ensure that all steps are successfully completed.
- If the chromosome number is not specified as an argument, the script will display usage instructions and exit.
- The output of the mishap test will be stored in the directory specified by OUTPUT_DIR.
